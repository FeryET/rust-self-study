# Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust Learning Journey! This repository documents my progress as I dive into learning Rust, a system programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency.

## Overview

This project is a personal endeavor to learn Rust through various resources. It includes examples, exercises, and notes from books and repositories. My learning sources include:

1. **Official Rust Documentation and Books**: Key books I'm using include:
   - "The Rust Programming Language" (commonly referred to as "the book")
   - "Rustlings (Rust by Example)"

2. **Additional Resources**:
   - The repository [100-exercises-to-learn-rust](https://github.com/someuser/100-exercises-to-learn-rust), which provides practical exercises to reinforce my understanding of Rust concepts.

## Learning Strategy

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of Rust, I've broken down my learning process as follows:

1. **Reading and Understanding**:
   - Read chapters from "The Rust Programming Language" and "Rust by Example".
   - Take notes on key concepts and new information.

2. **Applying Concepts through Examples**:
   - Complete examples from "Rust by Example".
   - Write code snippets and small projects based on what I learn.

3. **Practice with Exercises**:
   - Work through tasks from the "100-exercises-to-learn-rust" repository.
   - Implement solutions and understand different ways to approach problems in Rust.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections:

In each of the [100 Exercises to Laarn Rust]("./100-exercises-to-learn-rust"), [Rust Book]("./rust-book") and [Rustlings]("./rustlings") folders, there is a book folder containing the submodule to the book I'm reading that will be updated as I read through the books. There is also a "solutions" folder that contains solutions to problems/exercisese stated to each book. Each solution contains the following structures:

- **docs/**: Contains notes and summaries of key concepts from "The Rust Programming Language" and "Rust by Example".
- **examples/**: Code examples and small projects developed while following "Rust by Example".
- **exercises/**: Solutions to exercises from the "100-exercises-to-learn-rust" repository.
- **projects/**: Larger projects developed to apply learning in a more comprehensive way.
